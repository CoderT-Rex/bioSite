    <p>Diana Elaine Rex (born Fadal) was born in Texas before moving to Florida to work in a theme parkâ€™s design department.
    There she met her husband, Joshua Rex.
    They married after dating for four years and live with a dog in their small townhouse.</p>

	<p>As a volunteer, Diana has co-led youth ministry with Joshua for eight years, been part of the church worship team, and helped the Crossing Church with creative direction.
    For work she has done motion and graphic design for theme parks, travel agencies, and a security company.
    She has been commissioned for webtoon illustrations and children's books.
    She has also taught at her alma mater, Savannah College of Art and Design.</p>

        <p> Diana has always been a fan of Japanese culture, as a young girl enjoying many anime tv shows.
    She even turned her dollhouse into a ninja training dojo.
    She and her husband took a trip to Japan just after the pandemic, and she particularly liked the sushi and grilled beef.
    The hiking in Kyoto was beautiful, as well as the deer in Nara Park, and the high-tech city of Tokyo.
    The trip was a childhood dream and something she would like to do again.</p>

	<p>Diana and her husband enjoy playing board games together, such as Gloomhaven, Pandemic, and Quacks of Quedlinburg.
    They have spent time together creating props and cosplaying at conventions.
    Diana taught Josh to play the ukulele when they were dating, and they enjoy making up silly songs together.
    They both hope and pray for a large family and are pregnant with their first child.</p>
